The following video demonstrates the below steps:

1. Add a Mac node with Apple-Silicon chip to a Kubernetes cluster (in seconds!).
2. Manually start Bronze Willow (BW) on the Mac node (top-right terminal).
3. Deploy [tinyllama](https://ollama.com/library/tinyllama) with 2 replicas.
4. Access the OpenAI API-compatible endpoint through [mods](https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods).
